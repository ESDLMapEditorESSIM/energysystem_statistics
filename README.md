# ESDL EnergySysten Statistics

Service that gives back metrics / statistics on the input ESDL

This service is called from the ESDL MapEditor and the results are visualized in the ESDL MapEditor again (as a collection of tables).
Note: This visualization code needs to be changed when the structure of the results of this service changes (at least for the time being)
